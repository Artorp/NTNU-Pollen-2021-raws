/SLIDE_ID/HORIZ_ID/*.czi

SLIDE_ID is the identifier for the digitalized slide, identified by date and location.

HORIZ_ID is a folder with images for each horizontal swipe during digitalization. It is identified by the vertical position of the microscope in mm. During digitalization, a vertical position is set and the horizontal position is altered. In a pollen trap, the slide slides vertically 1mm each hour, the vertical position is thus an indication of time.

The images are saved lossless in czi format, which can be opened with the ZEN 3.1 (Blue edition) software.

Each directory with images also contain a group.txt which contains grouping information. It consists of the number of images in a group, one number per line, traversing the folder in alphabetical order.
